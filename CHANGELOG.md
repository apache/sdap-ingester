## [1.2.0] - 2023-09-14
### Added
- SDAP-477: Added preprocessor to properly shape incoming data
- SDAP-478: Add support to user to select subgroup of interest in input granules

## [1.1.0] - 2023-04-26
### Added
- SDAP-437: Added support for preprocessing of input granules. Initial implementation contains one preprocessor implementation for squeezing one or more dimensions to ensure the dataset is shaped as needed.
- SDAP-483: Added `.asf.yaml` to configure Jira auto-linking.
### Changed
### Deprecated
### Removed
### Fixed
- SDAP-423: Fixed verbosity settings not propagating to ingester subprocesses
- SDAP-417: Fixed bug where very spatially narrow tiles would have their WKT for the geo field represent the incorrect shape (ie a very narrow polygon being rounded to a line), which would cause an error on write to Solr.
- SDAP-435: Added case for handling time arrays of type `np.timedelta64`
### Security

## [1.0.0] - 2022-12-05
### Added
### Changed
 - SDAP-408: Improve L2 satellite data ingestion speed
   - Improved fault tolerance of writes to data & metadata stores. For ingestion pipelines that generate many tiles, the data stores may fail on some writes which was treated as an unrecoverable failure. Now more tolerant of this.
   - Batched writes: Reduced the number of network IO operations by consolidating writes of tile data + metadata.
   - Removed unnecessary function call. Removed an unneeded function call that seemed to be consuming a lot of pipeline runtime.
   - Batched tasks submitted to executors in pool. Saves wasted time switching between completed & new tasks.
- Added missing ASF headers to all .py files in this repository.
- Added ASF `README` for release.
